# Image Processing Filters & Techniques

This repository contains implementations of fundamental **Image Processing** operations and filters as part of academic laboratory work.  
The project covers **spatial domain**, **frequency domain**, **noise models**, and **morphological operations** applied on both **Grayscale** and **RGB** images.
